A standard test flow using <code>adb</code> commands:

- [ ] Display the list of currently connected devices
 							
- [ ] Install .apk file on the emulator using an appropriate command redirection option
 							
- [ ] Install .apk file on the device connected with USB using an appropriate command
 								
- [ ] redirection option (​for those who don't have physical device:​ still run the command and copy a console output; once your get the output, use Ctrl+C - Mac and Windows - to continue)
 							
- [ ] Re-install .apk file on the emulator using serial number as command redirection option
 							
- [ ] Using adb, take a screenshot and pull it onto your computer's Desktop
 							
- [ ] Using adb, record a 30-second video (use TIME option as explained in Notes) and
 								
- [ ] pull it onto your computer's Desktop
 							
- [ ] Push a .png file from your computer to the emulator's sdcard
 							
- [ ] Uninstall .apk from the emulator (and the physical device if it has been used)
